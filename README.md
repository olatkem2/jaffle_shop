## This Project will document the basic models, sources, tests, documentation and deployment tasks in a dbt project

This is me trying to solidify my understanding on the fundamentals of dbt with use cases.

You are invited to follow along!!!

## Tools

1. Visual Studio Code
2. BigQuery
3. Github and CLI
4. Any other online resource

## Steps

1. Install dbt using; pip install dbt-bigquery -- dbt core and big query Adapter will be installed with adapter status 
2. If you are having trouble getting your dbt version, try this; Add the directory in which dbt was installed as a path in your environment variables using control panel and restart CLI, dbt --version
3. Change the directory you want to save your project in the CLI i.e cd jaffle_shop for instance (you can create a folder on your preferred location)
4. Create an empty repository and give it a descriptive title on Github
5. Clone the Github repository by running  a git clone https://github.com/username/repo_name into the directory/folder you have created
6. Change directory to point to the cloned folder from Github
7. Run a git init followed bt=y the project_name
